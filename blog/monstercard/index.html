<h1>Changing YGO&#39;s Monster Card Design</h1>
<h2>Feb 26, 2024</h2>
<article><p>I had this thought this morning. What if I make a tiny change towards YGO's
monster cards? Making how they work similar to card games (MTG). What if
attacking a monster with higher defense reduce their defense until you can
destroy them in battle? It's fun to think how this small change will change
how YGO plays. I'm planning to make a simple prototype with YGO Ultimate
Masters 2006 as the base. Of course, moving on from a simple prototype will be
a major undertaking.</p>
